# Change
A program that directs a cashier how to give change.
The program has two inputs: the amount due and the amount received form the customer.
Display the dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies that the customer should receive in return. In order to avoid roundoff errors, 
the program user should supply both amounts in pennies (for example 274 instead of 2.74).
